    Projects a 1D sub-stellar solution onto a 2D grid. This function preserves
    the maximum altitude of the 1D ray, so that the 2D output looks like a half
    circle. Values in the numpy 2D array outside of the circle radius are set to
    0. This will also ensure 0 density and no optical depth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r1 : array_like
        Altitude values from planet core in cm (ascending!).
    q1 : array_like
        1D quantity to project.
    Rp : numeric
        Planet core radius in cm. Needed because we start there, and not
        necessarily at the lowest r-value (which may be slightly r[0] != Rp).
    numb : int, optional
        The number of bins in the y-directtion (impact parameters).
        Twice this number is used in the x-direction (l.o.s.). Default is 101.
    x_projection : bool, optional
        Whether to return the projection of q1(r1) in the x direction.
        For example for radial outflow velocities, to convert it to a velocity in
        the x-direction, set this to True so that you get v_x, where positive v_x
        are in the x-direction, i.e. from the star towards the observer. Default
        is False.
    cut_at : numeric, optional
        Radius at which we 'cut' the 2D structure and set values to 0.
        For example, cut_at=sim.p.Rroche to set density 0 outside Roche radius.
        Default is None.
    skip_alt_range : tuple, optional
        Altitude range to skip for the whole 2D projection. Values within this
        range will be set to 0. Must be specified as a tuple (min_alt, max_alt).
        Default is None.
    skip_alt_range_dayside : tuple, optional
        Altitude range to skip for the dayside of the 2D projection. Values
        within this range will be set to 0. Must be specified as a tuple
        (min_alt, max_alt). Default is None.
    skip_alt_range_nightside : tuple, optional
        Altitude range to skip for the nightside of the 2D projection. Values
        within this range will be set to 0. Must be specified as a tuple
        (min_alt, max_alt). Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    b_edges : array_like
        Impact parameters for 2D rays, the boundaries of the 'rays'.
    b_centers : array_like
        The actual positions of the rays and this is where the quantity is
        calculated at.
    x : array_like
        Total x grid with both negative and positive values (for day- and
        nightside).
    q2 : array_like
        Projected quantity onto the 2D grid.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If arrays are not in order of ascending altitude or if skip_alt_range,
        skip_alt_range_dayside, or skip_alt_range_nightside are not specified

        Chemical species to include in the calculations. Molecules are not supported.
        This argument distinguishes between atoms and ions, so for example 'Fe' will
        only calculate lines originating from atomic iron. To calculate lines from
        singly or doubly ionized iron, you must include 'Fe+' and 'Fe+2', respectively.
    numrays : int, optional
        Number of rays with different distance from the planet we project the 1D profiles onto.
        Higher number leads to slower computation times but higher accuracy, by default 100.
    width_fac : numeric, optional
        A multiplication factor for the 'max_voigt_width' variable within this function,
        which sets how far to either side of the rest-frame line centroid
        we calculate optical depths for every line.
        Standard value is 5 Gaussian standard deviations + 5 Lorentzian gammas.
        For very strong lines such as Ly-alpha, you may need a value >1 to properly calculate
        the far wings of the line. By default 1.
    ab : array-like, optional
        Quadratic limb darkening parameters. Either a list/array of two values if the
        limb-darkening is wavelength-independent, or an array with shape (len(wavs),2)
        if the limb-darkening is wavelength-dependent. By default np.zeros(2).
    phase : numeric, optional
        Planetary orbital phase defined as 0<phase<1 where 0 is mid-transit.
        The current implementation of phase does not take into account the
        tidally-locked rotation of the planet. So you'll always see the
        exact same projection (terminator) of the planet, just against
        a different limb-darkened stellar background. As long as the atmosphere is 1D
        symmetric, which we are assuming, this is exactly the same. But if in the
        future e.g. day-to-nightside winds are added on top, it will matter. By default 0.
    phase_bulkshift : bool, optional
        If phase != 0, the planet will have a nonzero bulk radial velocity in the stellar rest-frame.
        If this parameter is set to True, that velocity shift will be imposed on the transit spectrum as well.
        If this parameter is set to False, the spectral lines will still be at their rest-frame wavelengths. By default False.
    v_turb : float, optional
        Root mean-squared of turbulent velocities in units of cm s-1. Turbulent
        motion will lead to extra spectral line broadening. By default 0.
    cut_at : numeric, optional
        Radius at which we 'cut' the atmospheric profile and set values to 0.
        For example, use cut_at=sim.p.Rroche to set density 0 outside the Roche radius.
        Default is None (i.e., entire atmosphere included).

    Maps out the optical depth at one specific wavelength.

    This function maps out the optical depth along the direction
    of the Cloudy simulation (i.e., the substellar ray). To do proper radiative
    transfer calculations, one needs to calculate the optical depth in a 2D-projected
    plane. The tau_12D() function can be used for that.

    ----------
    sim : tools.Sim
        Cloudy simulation output of an upper atmosphere. Needs to have tools.Planet and
        tools.Parker class attributes.
