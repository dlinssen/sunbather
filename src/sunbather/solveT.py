def check_converged(fc, HCratio, newTe, prevTe, linthresh=50.0):
    """
    Checks whether the temperature profile is converged. At every radial cell,
    it checks for three conditions, one of which must be satisfied:
    1. The H/C ratio is less than fc (this is the "main" criterion).
    2. The newly proposed temperature profile is within the temperature difference
    that a H/C equal to fc would induce. In principle, we would expect that if
    this were the case, H/C itself would be < fc, but smoothing of the
    temperature profile can cause different behavior. For example, we can get stuck
    in a loop where H/C > fc, we then propose a new temperature profile that is
    significantly different, but then after the smoothing step we end up with
    the profile that we had before. To break out of such a loop that never converges,
    we check if the temperature changes are less than we would expect for an
    "fc-converged" profile, even if H/C itself is still >fc. In practice, this
    means that the temperature profile changes less than 0.3 * log10(1.1),
    which is ~1%, so up to 100 K for a typical profile.
    3. The newly proposed temperature profile is less than `linthresh` different
    from the last iteration. This can be assumed to be precise enough convergence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fc : numeric
        Convergence threshold for the total heating/cooling ratio.
    HCratio : numpy.ndarray
        Heating/cooling imbalance, output of the calc_HCratio() function.
    newTe : numpy.ndarray
        Newly proposed temperature profile based on both relaxation and
        construction algorithms, in units of K.
    prevTe : numpy.ndarray
        Temperature profile of the previous iteration in units of K.
    linthresh : numeric, optional
        Convergence threshold for T(r) as an absolute temperature difference
        in units of K, by default 50.

    Returns
    -------
    converged : bool
        Whether the temperature profile is converged.
