# This file stores the index no. until which the Cloudy 'save energies/densities' from the .en file agree with the NIST database. At higher energies, they will start to diverge. The numbers for Cloudy 17.02 were manually confirmed by D. Linssen for each species. For C23.01, I only checked if the energies agree at least up to this number, so perhaps higher energy levels also agree in some cases. Some species are missing from this list, this is because they have no lines with the necessary coefficients in the NIST database and so there's no use saving their densities with Cloudy (even though the energies may in principle agree with those of NIST).
