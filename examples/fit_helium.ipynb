    "In this example notebook, we fit an observed He 10830 Å signal with a grid of Parker wind models in order to constrain the mass-loss rate of the planet. This is a commonly applied method (e.g., Paragas et al. 2021; Lampon et al. 2021), but it often results in a degeneracy between the free parameters of the Parker wind model: the temperature and the mass-loss rate. Constraints on the mass-loss rate are therefor usually not very stringent. In this notebook, we follow the approach described in Linssen et al. (2022), to mitigate this. We fit the helium line and combine this with additional constraints on the Parker wind temperature parameter, in order to break the degeneracy and get better constraints on the mass-loss rate. We use the helium signal of WASP-52 b as observed by Kirk et al. (2022)."

    "Doing a concise analysis requires running a grid of Parker wind models with different temperatures ($T_0$) and mass-loss rates ($\\dot{M}$), which can be computationally expensive (depending on the size of the grid). Here, we run a very small (3x3) grid of Parker wind models in order to demonstrate the technique and code commands, while keeping the computational time to a minimum. The output files of this small grid can then be substituted by output files of a larger grid, which we pre-ran and provide in the /examples/materials/ folder.\n",

    "- Step 1. Generate the $T_0$-$\\dot{M}$ grid of isothermal (!) Parker wind models.\n",
    "- Step 2. Run the Parker wind models through Cloudy to find a non-isothermal temperature profile and the metastable helium density.\n",
    "- Step 3. Make synthetic helium transit spectra for each model and fit those to the observed value.\n",
    "- Step 4. Constrain the temperature parameter-space by assessing the model self-consistency.\n",

And some of the steps are performed inside a user-made Python file/Jupyter notebook (e.g. saving the helium spectrum of each Parker wind profile, doing the Bayesian analysis to extract the mass-loss rate).

If you want to model additional planets, you can simply add lines in the _planets.txt_ file with their parameters, there is no need to replace previous planet parameters. The last column of the _planets.txt_ file specifies the **name** of the stellar SED that we want to use. The SED with exactly this name must be available to *Cloudy*, so it must be placed in its source folder, specifically: _/path/to/c17.02/data/SED/_. In the _/sunbather/stellar_SEDs/_ folder, we have provided the SED that we are going to use for WASP-52 b. This is the MUSCLES spectrum (France et al. 2016; Youngblood et al. 2016; Loyd et al. 2016) of eps Eri, which is a similar spectral type to WASP-52.

In our case, we only need atomic helium, i.e. \"He\". There are a few optional arguments (see wiki), and one that we will use here, is the `bp` argument to include a transit impact parameter. We have stored the impact parameter of WASP-52 b in the *planets.txt* file, and the way we can quickly access this in Python, is by using a `Planet` object, which is a class defined in `tools.py` and which simply stores the parameters of the system (see wiki). You can manually create a `Planet` object as e.g. `W52b = tools.Planet('WASP52b')` and access the parameters as e.g. `W52b.bp`, but this `Planet` object is also automatically loaded as the `p` attribute of the `Sim` object. So, for a `Sim` object called `sim`, we can access the transit impact parameter as `sim.p.bp`."

Thus, we calculate the mean of the converged/non-isothermal temperature profiles weighted by the number density of metastable helium (this will be done by the `metaHe_weighted_T()` function and stored in the `T_He` variable and its standard deviation in the `sigmaT` variable). We then calculate the difference between this weighted temperature and the isothermal value $T_0$, which is the `dT` variable.

    "Now that we have both the fit of the models to the data, and the constraints on the self-consistency of the parameter space, we can combine the two in a Bayesian framework to get a posterior distribution of the temperature and mass-loss rate of WASP-52 b. As a reminder, Bayes' theorem reads as follows:\n",

This is what we want to know. $P(data | T, \\dot{M})$ is the *likelihood* of the data, so this is what we get from fitting our data with a model as done in Step 3. $P(T, \\dot{M})$ is the *prior* expectation of how likely each model is (i.e. the self-consistency of the Parker wind models based on the temperature and not the data). $P(data)$ is what is called the *(model) evidence* and is basically a normalization factor. Here we write it as the sum of all considered models, which assumes that the true values of $T$ and $\\dot{M}$ are within our considered parameter space. In our example, this assumption is probably fine, but if you run a scenario with a very limited extent of the $T-\\dot{M}$ parameter space, the assumption might break and the posterior that you get from this code is not robust.\n",

Remember that for a 1D Gaussian, the 1, 2 and 3 $\\sigma$ contours are defined by the area that comprises 68%, 95% and 99.7% of the probability density function. However, for a 2D Gaussian, these values are 39%, 86% and 89.9% (see e.g. https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/sigmas/)."
