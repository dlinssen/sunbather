    "In this example notebook, we predict the NUV spectrum of WASP-52 b to see if the signatures of escaping metal species are strong enough to be potentially observable with HST/STIS. In the *fit_helium.ipynb* example notebook, we constrained the mass-loss rate and thermospheric temperature of the planet based on metastable helium observations (the examples can be done in any order). Here, we use those constrained values and make NUV predictions. Since we do not know the (upper) atmospheric metallicity of WASP-52 b, we will explore three different models; one assuming solar metallicity, one assuming 10x solar metallicity, and one assuming 10x solar metallicity but a 100x solar magnesium abundance.

    "For this exercise, we assume you have all codes set-up. That is; you have downloaded *sunbather* and installed its dependencies (the Python packages, including *p-winds*). You have installed *Cloudy v17.02* and have the path to it stored as your _\\$CLOUDY_PATH_ environmental variable. You have created your \"project\" folder, and have the path to it stored as your _\\$SUNBATHER_PROJECT_PATH_ environmental variable. You have copied the _planets.txt_ file to the project path. These steps are described in more detail in the \"installation\" section of the _sunbather_ wiki.\n",

    "Before *sunbather* can create Parker wind profiles, we need to make sure the parameters of the system are available to the code. The parameters are stored in the _\\$SUNBATHER_PROJECT_PATH/planets.txt_ file, and the parameters of the WASP-52 b system have already been added. If you want to model additional planets, you can simply add lines in the _planets.txt_ file with their parameters, there is no need to replace previous planet parameters. The last column of the _planets.txt_ file specifies the **name** of the stellar SED that we want to use. The SED with exactly this name must be available to *Cloudy*, so it must be placed in its source folder, specifically: _\\$CLOUDY_PATH/data/SED/_. In the _/sunbather/stellar_SEDs/_ folder, we have provided the SED that we are going to use for WASP-52 b. This is the MUSCLES spectrum (France et al. 2016; Youngblood et al. 2016; Loyd et al. 2016) of eps Eri, which is a similar spectral type to WASP-52. The code is very specific about the format of the spectrum, so we refer to the wiki on how to prep your stellar SED for *sunbather*. "

Calling `help(sunbather.construct_parker.run)` will give an overview of the available arguments. In this module, the atmospheric composition/metallicity only affects the structure through the mean molecular weight $\\mu$. At solar metallicity, the metal content is low enough to not significantly affect $\\mu$, so we will make the Parker wind profile with *p-winds* standalone, assuming a pure H/He composition of 90/10. At 10x solar metallicity, $\\mu$ may be significantly affected by the metal content, so we will make the Parker wind profile with a hybrid *p-winds*/_Cloudy_ calculation. In Step 2 of this example, we will use this profile also for the run with an enhanced magnesium abundance, since $\\mu$ (and hence the structure we calculate here in step 1) will not change much when increasing the abundance of just one metal species.\n",

Since we explore different compositions, `construct_parker` always expects you to give a folder name `pdir` where we want to store our Parker profiles. We reccommend using a descriptive name, so in this case we will go with *fH_0.9* and the path where our profiles will be saved is then _$SUNBATHER_PROJECT_PATH/parker_profiles/WASP52b/fH_0.9/_."
